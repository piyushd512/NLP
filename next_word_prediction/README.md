### Next Word Prediction Model Using LSTM Layers with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for a next word prediction model implemented with TensorFlow, featuring a simple architecture utilizing LSTM layers.

#### Overview:
The implemented model aims to predict the next word in a sequence of text. It utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. The model learns from input sequences and predicts the most probable next word based on the context provided.

#### Key Features:
- **LSTM-Based Architecture**: The model is built using LSTM layers, enabling it to capture sequential patterns and dependencies within the input text.
- **Next Word Prediction**: Given a sequence of words, the model predicts the most likely next word, facilitating applications such as text completion and suggestion.
- **Simple Design**: The model features a straightforward architecture, making it easy to understand and implement for beginners.


#### Contributing:
Contributions to the project are welcome! Whether it's bug fixes, performance improvements, or new features, your contributions are valuable. Feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues to help enhance the next word prediction model.
