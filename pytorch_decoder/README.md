### Next Word Prediction Model with PyTorch Decoder Using Transformer Architecture

The model is designed to predict the next word in a sentence using the transformer decoder architecture. By leveraging PyTorch and the Huggingface library, it provides an efficient and effective solution for text generation tasks.

#### Key Features:
- **Transformer Decoder Architecture**: The model utilizes the transformer decoder architecture, renowned for its ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.
- **Next Word Prediction**: Given a partial sentence, the model predicts the most likely next word, facilitating applications such as text completion and suggestion.
- **PyTorch and Huggingface Integration**: The model is implemented using PyTorch and leverages the capabilities of the Huggingface library for dataset.


#### Requirements:
- PyTorch library
- Huggingface library
- Python
