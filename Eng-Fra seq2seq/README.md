### English to French Translator Using TensorFlow Sequence-to-Sequence Model

This repository contains code for a sequence-to-sequence model implemented with the TensorFlow library. The model comprises an encoder and a decoder, both utilizing LSTM layers. The encoder network processes input sequences, while the decoder network generates output sequences. The model's objective is to accurately translate English sentences into their corresponding French equivalents.

#### Key Features:
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Model with LSTM Layers**: The model's encoder and decoder networks leverage LSTM layers to capture long-range dependencies and sequential patterns in the input and output sequences.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: The encoder processes input data, and its final state is passed to the decoder to generate translated sequences.
- **English-to-French Translation**: Tailored for translating English text into French, the model learns linguistic nuances and produces translations.

#### Requirements:
- TensorFlow library (version 2.15.0)
- Python (version 3.15)

#### Contributing:
Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to improve the functionality and performance of the translator.
