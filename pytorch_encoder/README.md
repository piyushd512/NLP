### Sentiment Analysis Model with PyTorch Encoder Inspired by Transformer Architecture

The model is tailored for sentiment analysis tasks, leveraging PyTorch for architecture creation and the Hugging Face library for dataset handling. Inspired by the transformer encoder architecture, it effectively captures contextual information for sentiment classification.

#### Key Features:
- **Transformer Encoder Architecture**: The model's architecture draws inspiration from the transformer encoder, allowing it to efficiently process input sequences and extract contextual embeddings.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Designed specifically for sentiment analysis, the model analyzes input text and predicts the sentiment associated with it, such as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **PyTorch and Hugging Face Integration**: The model is implemented using PyTorch for architecture creation and leverages the Hugging Face library for dataset preparation and processing, simplifying the workflow.

#### Requirements:
- PyTorch library
- Hugging Face library
- Python
